One of the most important questions that Muslim traders ask is whether
or not Quotex is halal. Halal is an Arabic word that means
"permissible" or "lawful". In Islamic law, halal refers to
anything that is permitted or lawful according to the teachings of the
Quran and the Sunnah (the teachings and practices of the Prophet
Muhammad). Trading in binary options, forex, and CFDs is generally
considered to be halal, as long as the trader does not engage in any
form of gambling or usury.

traders who have a bigger investment budget. The VIP Account is the
premium account type and is designed for professional traders.
